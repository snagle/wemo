# wemo
based on the original wemo control script by rich@netmagi.com

i fixed the get friendly name, in the original, it would change your device name!
cleaned up by adding functions
refactored the port test
added a toggle method
added a scan method

i set my wemos to have "static ips" thru the dhcp config on my router

so i updated the scan function accordingly
